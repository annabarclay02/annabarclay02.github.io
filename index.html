			<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>Media literacy is a key skill to navigating the online world effectively and accurately.</p>
				<p>Rampant misinformation and fake news, as well as the overstimulation of social media has weakened young peoples' attention spans and media literacy skills, causing serious problems with their consumption of online media and content.</p>
				<p>This website aims to prepare and equip teachers and educators of young people with the skills to inform their students on the importance of consuming media critically and forming healthy online habits. It will be used to inform them on the importance of media literacy skills and use real life examples to relate the information to their experiences online.</p>
				<p>Throughout the next few webpages, I will show how I aim to design and build my site with reference to content, structure, multimedia, and accessibility - along with many other aspects.</p>
