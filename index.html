			<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>Media literacy is a key skill to navigating the online world effectively and accurately.</p>

					 causing serious problems with their consumption of online media and content.</p>
				<p>This website aims to prepare and equip teachers and educators of young people with the skills to inform their students on the importances of consuming
					 media critically and forming healthy online habits. It will be used to inform them on the importance of media literacy skills and use real life examples to
