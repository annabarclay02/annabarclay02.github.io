      <h3>Evaluating Professional Writing Characteristics</h3>
				 <p>Using the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> website we can evaluate how effective it is in terms of the 14 professional writing characteristics previously outlined:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Accuracy – as an official government website it must be accurate, this includes textually and factually.</li>
              <li>Active voice – the site uses a very formal and active voice when delivering information.</li>
              <li>Limit biases – the site publishes many of Joe Biden’s speeches and press releases that have been vetted and written by various publicists to ensure their exclusion of bias, however, due to the fact that they are direct quotations there may be some bias present due to the political nature of many of the press releases.</li>
              <li>Clarity – the site uses some political jargon that is largely unavoidable due to the context of the content, but it does seem to pay direct attention to making the text easy for users to understand.</li>
              <li>Conciseness – Most of the content is fairly concise but due to the amount of information that needs to be conveyed, it is a very text heavy website.</li>
              <li>Conversational and smoothly flowing prose – due to the formal nature of the site, the language used is not wholly conversational.</li>
              <li>Correctness – the site uses correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.</li>
              <li>Parallelism – as the site is largely supposed to be informative over argumentative parallelism only really appears in copies of Joe Biden’s speech.</li>
              <li>Positive voice – due to the political nature of the site, it makes a conscious effort to convey the correct voice at all times.</li>
              <li>Strong nouns and verbs – clear and concise, no overuse of the verb to be.</li>
              <li>Sentence variability – sentences are all varied and carefully constructed before published.</li>
              <li>Simple words – simple words are used when they can be, but some complex words are necessary to make sure the information is communicated accurately.</li>
              <li>Shorter paragraphs – paragraphs are short and broken up to make them easily digestible.</li>
              <li>Tone and voice – the tone is relatively formal and informative.</li>
            </ol>

      <h3>The AWE Writing Process</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Assess
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Define audience</li>
              <li>Define purpose</li>
              <li>Conduct research</li>
              <li>Organise, categorise, and outline</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Write
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Create a draft</li>
              <li>Read and revise</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Edit
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Check for correctness and organisation</li>
              <li> Paragraph and sentence level editing</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h3>Reflective Statement</h3>
        <p>I feel that I have completed steps a–c of the Assess section of the AWE Writing Process. D needs more work to fully organise and outline what I wish to write and when I want it to be communicated on the site.</p>

    <h3>Using Voyant Tools</h3>
      <p>Voyant tools showed how the White House homepage most used words were white, house, Biden, president, and new.
        <br>The graph it provided shows that white is rarely seen without house and president is rarely used without Biden.</p>

    <h3>Samples of Text</h3>
      <p>With reference to the needs of your chosen audience which you identified in Week 2, select 2-3 key points in your narrative (defined in Week 3) and write a sample paragraph for each. For example, you might:
            - write an opening statement to grab the user's attention.
            - compose a section that contextualises your topic.
            - present a key argument and discuss its impact.
            - deliver a conclusion and wind down the narrative to a satisfying end.
          When you have done this, reflect on how these examples are suitable for a multimedia website. You can do this by analysing them in terms of the professional writing characteristics, using your audience profile and/or using the data gathered from Voyant. You should also discuss your samples with someone (ideally from your target audience) to get their opinion on the design of your textual content. Write up this analysis (this can be as a paragraph, as a table, as mark-up on the samples of text etc.).</p>
