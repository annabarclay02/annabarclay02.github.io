     		 <h3>Reflection on the Creative Process</h3>
				 <p>Preparation: I think I have prepared well in the creative process. I have looked at many similar websites and read many articles about media literacy for young people. This has helped me decide on my approach and it has been very helpful to see what has and hasn’t worked for other sites. It is useful to see what I find engaging in sites similar to my own, and to understand where I become disengaged.</p> 
				 <p>Incubation: For the incubation stage of the process, I think I need to focus more on linking my collected resources together. They all stand by themselves but are connected in a variety of ways that I need to link. Through some trial and error I have finalised a structure of my site and decided on the layout that has made the incubation stage a lot clearer for me.</p> 
				 <p>Ideation: In terms of ideation, now that I have a decided structure this will be a lot easier. I didn’t have an ‘aha’ moment as such but the whole concept makes a lot more sense in my mind now and I know the direction I need to take and things I need to do, I have the idea ready to go and the evaluation and implementation are the next steps.</p>
				 <p>Evaluation: I believe this idea is worth pursuing as I believe that teachers require a resource that can help them understand their students and their safety online. There are already a few resources similar to this, however, I have found that the current sites tend to focus on one aspect, solution, or age group and therefore don’t address the situation as deeply as they could. The evaluation process led me to make several changes to my idea. I had originally aimed to make a site aimed at teenagers to help them learn about media literacy by themselves before I decided to switch the focus to helping teachers. I decided to switch my idea as I was unsure that teenagers would be as proactive and keen to learn about media literacy as I hoped they would be.</p> 
				 <p>Implementation: I am still in the process of fully implementing my ideas into the full-scale website, but I hope this proposal will convey the ideas and focus effectively.</p>

      <h3>Relevant Sites and Their Use of Images</h3>
        <p>Below is my analysis of similar resources and their chosen use of images:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.commonsense.org/education/articles/media-literacy-resources-for-classrooms">Common Sense Website</a>
				<ul>
					<li>Common Sense’s images are largely used for aesthetics purposes. However, I don’t think the images they chose are completely effective. The first picture featured below the title isn’t the best quality and is slightly pixelated, this becomes even more obvious when you zoom in therefore we can assume they have used a raster graphic. The other digital images used on their page are small icons to illustrate what each following section is about. While these icons are a nice effect, they are small and slightly too mundane to have any real effect. I think they were used to try and break up the text, but they don’t do this very effectively, largely down to their size and the fact that they are only in black and white – some colour may catch user’s eyes more. Their positioning above the text is also a little awkward and doesn’t seem entirely thought through.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://beinternetawesome.withgoogle.com/en_uk/">Be Internet Awesome</a>
				<ul>
					<li>The Be Internet Awesome limits its use of pictures and instead opts for little icons, not dissimilar to the Common-Sense website. However, the Be Internet Awesome’s use of icons is much more effective. This is due to the choice of icons used and the positioning of them in relation to the text. The icons are relevant to the text next to them and are all different colours to help distinguish between ideas and separate the text further. The icons used are good quality and when zoomed in they retain their quality which makes me believe they are vector graphics. The difference between the use of icons here vs the previous website is huge and shows that while both had the same idea, one site executed it much more effectively than the other.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.internetmatters.org/schools-esafety/">Internet Matters</a>
				<ul>
					<li>The Internet Matters’ website uses the same style of digital images throughout their site making it a cohesive use of digital images. The images they use are largely of a variety of digitally drawn characters, all created in the same style. These are used mostly when linking to another page or section of the site as a way to convey what the next section may be about. These characters are all different age groups depending on the section of the site e.g. the secondary school section shows a teenage pupil in a school uniform while the primary school section shows a younger child. This is an effective way to speed up users’ navigation of the site as they cognitively understand what each link is for without having to read too much of the subtext.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://theguardianfoundation.org/programmes/behind-the-headlines">The Guardian Foundation</a>
				<ul>
					<li>Similarly to the Internet Matter’s site, the Guardian uses images as a way to link to further pages and articles. They use photos taken of classrooms using the Guardian Foundation’s programme throughout their site as a way to convey the successfulness and enjoyability of the programme. The photos inform the user of the types of work in the programme but can also act as somewhat of an advert for schools to implement in their classrooms.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.educateagainsthate.com/category/school-leaders/advice-and-training-school-leaders/">Educate Against Hate</a>
				<ul>
					<li>The Educate Against Hate doesn’t use any digital images for their site. Their use of colour and text stands on its own to represent the sites goals and different sections. While I think this is quite effective it has led me to get confused when navigating the site as many of the pages look the same. In some areas the text is also quite dense and some digitally created images or icons would help to navigate around the site instead of relying on the user to read and remember where they are on the site and within a group of close to identical pages. </li>

      <h3>Portfolio of Images</h3>
        <p>To collect images for my own site, I used <a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash</a>, <a href="https://www.pexels.com">Pexels</a>, and <a href="https://www.flaticon.com">Flaticon</a>. These sites all have free images that users are welcome to use.
		<br>Below is a collection of photos I gathered in my search. To find these images and icons I searched terms such as "classroom", "collaboration", "social media", "fake news", and "media literacy" along with many others.</p>
			<img src="master-files-images/img005-image-portfolio.png" alt="Collage of free pictures taken from Pexals, Unsplash, and Flaticon. These include photographs of classroom environments, digital icons, and images of people using social media">
	 
	  <h3>Image Editing</h3>
		<p>Image editing is crucial to the successfulness of multimedia sites. They must fit the style of the site and add to the enjoyment or comprehension of the site in some way. They also shouldn't distract from the content too much.<br>
			I have selected three images from the collection above to edit and display how image editing and exporting can impact effectiveness.</p>
			<img class="edited" src="master-files-images/img006-edited-mada-airfocus-800px-72ppi-greyscale.jpg" alt="greyscale photograph of people drawing on a whiteboard">
			<img class="edited" src="master-files-images/img007-edited-mada-books-552px-150ppi-greyscale.jpg" alt="greyscale photograph of a pile of books">
			<img class="edited" src="master-files-images/img008-edited-mada-computers-1500px-50ppi-indexed.jpg" alt="top-down view of a table of open laptops, phones, headphones, and other miscellaneous items">
		<p>To edit these pictures I changed their colouring, their scale, and their pixels per inch. I then cropped them all and exported them to compare the differences. Listed below is the ways I edited each image.<br>
			Image 1 (left): Greyscale, width = 800pixels, 72ppi, cropped<br>
			Image 2 (middle): Greyscale, width = 500pixel, 150ppi, cropped<br>
			Image 3 (right): Indexed, width = 1500pixels, 50ppi, cropped</p>	

		<h4>Reflection</h4>	
		<p>In my opinion, Image 1’s quality was the most unaffected by the edits. It is still largely usable, and I would give it a rating of 3/Passable. It is slightly pixelated and when zoomed in the pixels become very obvious which doesn’t look great, but it is usable if kept small. Image 2, is slightly more pixelated but I would also give it a rating of 3/Passable as it is useable. Changing the scale of the image pixelated it a lot, I think this could be down to the picture being slightly pixelated/not great quality to begin with. However, when it is small, it is still good quality and retains the detail of the image. For Image 3 I decided to convert the image to an indexed colour scale. This flattened out a lot of the colour and ruined a few of the details but largely kept the colours and look of the photo correct. Image 3 is by far the worst quality, and I would give it a 4/5 Marginal/Inferior rating. I wouldn’t want to use this edited version for my site as it is heavily pixelated. It is also a far larger file size compared to the two greyscale images. Images 1 and 2 are 85KB and 39KB, respectively, while Image 3 is 414KB. Optimising the images this way has helped to save space on my computer considering the original photos are all over 2MB and has helped me fully understand the effects of scaling on quality and size. For my project, I would take scaling the images into consideration and potentially employ the use of greyscale for some images if it seemed useful, however I do prefer full colour images, especially for a site that needs to retain the attention of users. I would in future avoid using the Indexed feature due to the loss of quality and colour when used.</p>
