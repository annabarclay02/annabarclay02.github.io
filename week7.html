     		 <h3>Reflection on the creative process</h3>
				 <p>Preparation: I think I have prepared well in the creative process. I have looked at many similar websites and read many articles about media literacy for young people. This has helped me decide on my approach and it has been very helpful to see what has and hasnâ€™t worked for other sites. It is useful to see what I find engaging in sites similar to my own, and to understand where I become disengaged.
					 	<br>Incubation: for the incubation stage of the process, I think I need to focus more on linking my collected resources together. They all stand by themselves but are connected in a variety of ways that I need to link.
