      <h3>Video Analysis</h3>
		 <p>Similarly to audio, I have chosen to analyse websites from the video section of the <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/websites/video/">Awwwards Video</a> site:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://gehry.getty.edu">Getty presents... Frank Gehry</a>
					<ul>
						<li>The employment of video for this site is very effective. It is used to enhance both the information comprehension and appeal to the site. There are many videos used throughout the site, however, they are not relied on and are instead used in conjunction with images, audio, and text. This creates a really well-rounded and accessible sight that can be used by anyone in a variety of situations. If you are unable to listen to the video, there are transcriptions to the left that can be read while the video plays. If the user only has time to read the text, they won’t miss out many important details about the site. It’s very versatile and suits different people’s preferred media. The benefits are that the videos have closed captioning, making them accessible. They are also easily skippable for those that don’t want to watch them. The videos aren’t very lengthy so they are easily consumable but added together they may take up more of the user’s time which people may not like. While some people may not like videos, they are easily avoidable on the site and can simply be scrolled past to get to the text. Due to the context of the site, it is very visual based, and I don’t think it would be as strong without these visual elements.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.coprec.co.jp/">COPREC</a> 
					<ul>
						<li>The use of video is very clean in this site. The whole site is very well organised, and the videos are cohesive with the sites design, through colour-grading. I couldn’t find a place to access closed captions or a transcript, so considering the site is in Japanese, as are the videos, they didn’t help with my comprehension of the site particularly. The visuals draw the user in and the first video on the site conveys the business and effectiveness of their construction and factory. I don’t know if it is just my computer but when loading the site, the videos took a while to load completely and seemed to buffer for a while. This didn’t happen with any other sites, so I felt this interrupted my enjoyment of the website. The first video seems to be for mostly aesthetic purposes and loops, so it is easy to watch for a few seconds and continue scrolling. The main video on the home page is pretty short so users are unlikely to get bored, granted they speak Japanese.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://amycurrell.com/">Amy Currell</a>
					<ul>
						<li>The use of video for this site is very effective and simplistic. It mainly involves a video of all of Amy’s photography projects and as it plays the user has the ability to pause the video and explore each project further. This is a clever way to effectively showcase various projects within a short space of time without the user having to do anything. the only slight caveat is that the font for the links to the projects are relatively small and someone with bad eyesight may struggle to see them. Text on the sight is very limited and so the images and videos must speak for themselves.</li>

      <h3>Video Portfolio</h3>
        <p>I found my videos on <a href="https://pixabay.com">Pixabay</a> and <a href="https://pexels.com">Pexels</a>, both free sites with stock videos that are free for anyone to use. For my two chosen videos, I edited them using iMovie. The first I am hoping to employ as a background video for a welcome page/homepage. The second will be used when discussing lesson structures and teaching resources. I edited the first one so that it was a little longer and cut off the very start which began with a blank screen so that when it loops it is less obvious. The second video I slowed down a little as I thought the people were moving particularly fast. I also darkened and filtered the video a little bit as I thought the colours were a little blown out in the original, this has now made it more aesthetically cohesive. I saved these as 1080p, 720p, and 520p. There is a clear and obvious difference between the quality in the 1080p, and the 720p and 520p. The 1080p is much crisper and sharper, while the 520p, especially, is fuzzy and pixelated, therefore I have opted to use the 1080p version. I decided against including sound and effects as I didn’t want to distract from the website’s content, as the videos aren’t a huge focus. I will review this in future and in the actual building of the site and am open to changing this if deemed necessary.</p>
