        <h3>Task 1</h3>
		<p>Narratively, the site will be informative and specifically catered towards teachers. It is likely that teachers are very 
			familiar with the effects of poor media literacy, and they may see it on a regular basis within schools. 
			<br>As for the storyline, the site will start with a brief overview of the dangers and current stats on media 
			literacy. The site will then break down into tips and useful resources, videos, and multimedia, and at the end will
			summarise. It will follow a chronological navigation of the best places to start and then more resources to employ 
			and build on.
			<br>The narrative voice will be largely informal in order to effectively convey the intended information and to 
			convey a message of collaboration vs lecturing.</p>
