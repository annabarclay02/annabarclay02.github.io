      		 <h3>Establishing a Narrative and Structure</h3>
					<p>Narratively, the site will be informative and specifically catered towards teachers. It is likely that teachers are very familiar with the effects of poor media literacy, and they may see it on a regular basis within schools.</p>
					<p>The site will start with a brief overview of the dangers and current stats on media literacy. It will then break down into tips and useful resources, videos, and multimedia, and at the end will summarise. It will follow a chronological navigation of the best places to start and then more resources to employ and build on. The narrative voice will be largely informal in order to effectively convey the intended information and to convey a message of collaboration vs lecturing. The key to tackling this issue is conversations with students and so portraying a casual site will help break down the student-teacher barrier that could limit discussions.</p>
					<p>The structure of the website will be broken up into to age groups in order to help teachers navigate to the most relevant area and resources.</p>
					<p>Below is a mock up created by me on Freeform of what this structure could look like. Each age group section would contain be the relevant tips, resources, and activities for that age group.</p>
