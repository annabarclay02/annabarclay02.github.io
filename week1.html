      <h2>Week 1 Tasks</h2>
        <h3>Task 1</h3>
          <p>The effects of social media and increased use of technology on young people has always intrigued me. We are starting to see the impact these have had one
						young people and how it has affected various aspects of their experiences of the world.<br>
            I want to understand the effects that technology has had on young people’s media literacy skills and how their overwhelming social media consumption has
						led to decreased attention spans and low levels of media literacy. I would like my website to provide young people with information on media literacy and
						its importance as well as give them tips on how to consume content critically and make their own judgements on social media content that is presented as
						truth.<br>
            As a fairly popular topic right now, there are many academic sources and news articles discussing the issue of young people and their media literacy skills
						 and the search terms of “media literacy”, “young people”, “teens”, “attention span” used on combinations with each other gave me lots of results.<br></p>
