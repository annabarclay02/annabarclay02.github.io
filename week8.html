      <h3>Audio Analysis</h3>
		 <p>I couldn’t find any sites related to my topic that utilised audio throughout their site, so I decided to look at the <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/websites/sound-audio/">Awwwards Audio</a> website in order to find sites that employ audio effectively.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://gehry.getty.edu/">Getty presents... Frank Gehry</a>
					<ul>
						<li>The use of audio in this website is really effective. The use of classical music not only acts as a nice background noise to the website and the experience using the site but is also clearly connected to the website’s purpose as it is about the architecture and building of the Walt Disney Concert Hall, home to the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The specific music used are various recordings of the LA Philharmonic. The incorporation of audio adds to the overall experience of the website and doesn’t distract from the information it’s trying to convey and communicate. The audio for this site has been well thought out and draws the audience, making the website more enjoyable. For this specific site, the audio is completely optional and doesn’t begin to play until you click somewhere on the page as instructed, not clicking would allow you to enjoy the website without the audio if you were in a quiet place and didn’t want to disturb people, for example. This is an advantage as it allows the user to choose what kind of experience they would like to have and gives them the control and comfort to use the site wherever they are. The music plays alongside different videos that are played at each chapter of the site and culturally connects the content to the audio and its context. These videos explain the architecture of different sections of the concert hall and include soundbites and interviews with the architect. As the audio for these videos are largely speech, the background music fits quite cohesively and accompanies the speech.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://alightinthewoods.net">A Light in the Woods</a>
					<ul>
						<li>This website’s use of audio was also effective, employing audio for sound effects, , speech, and ambient sound. I found the sound on this website almost too much, but I think that is because I found the website strange to navigate and thus had frustrations with it. The sound effects were effective, and I thought the ambient sound of the birds and nature sounds to be appropriate and set the scene nicely. The site has a collection of audio books/stories and also an explore section where you can travel through nature/this mythical land. The use of sound and audio were incorporated well, however, as I didn’t find myself engaged in the site my opinion of the audio is therefore not as high as the first site which I found very interesting. I think the use of some background music at the start of the site would’ve engaged me more.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.supershine.design/">Supershine Design</a>
					<ul>
						<li>The Super Shine Design has a simple but effective approach to audio use. It has a nice piece of background music playing while the user scrolls through the site. The site by itself is very effective due to the design, which doesn’t come as a surprise considering the content is about their design company, but the audio elevates it a bit and works very well with the design and feel of the site. One element I didn’t like is that when the user leaves the site for another tab in the browser window, the music continues to play. I had to go back on the site and turn the sound off, which wasn’t the case with the other two websites I have looked. I wonder if this was a specific choice by the developers or an oversight. Combined with the images and animations on the site, the sound works very well to convey a bright, optimistic, and engaging site.</li>

      <h3>Audio Portfolio</h3>
        <p>Due to the nature of my website, I don’t see a specific need for audio as would be the case with a site supporting a game or other form of entertainment. I feel as if persistent audio may overwhelm the site and be unnecessary, but I do think that some subtle sound effects might help with engaging the audience and be an effective contribution to the usability of the site. I have chosen two audio files that I think would make suitable sound effects.</p>
     <h4>Editing Audio</h4>
		<p>Using Audacity I shortened both of these audio samples to only include the sound I needed. As my intention is to use them as sound effects for buttons or other commands, they need to be short and void of any introduction that would cause a delay in the sound effect. Therefore, I cut the beginning of both audios so that the sound effect would play immediately. Due to the length of the audios and the lack of variability in the sound, exporting at different qualities and formats didn’t make much of a difference, hence I am able to use a lower quality audio that doesn’t take up much computer space compared to a higher quality format, without jeopardising the sound. Therefore I will be using the Medium (145-185 kbps) Joint Stereo MP3 as this was the Stereo option that took up the least amount of space at only 5KB. I have opted for Stereo as both of the original recordings are in Stereo, and Stereo tends to be more dynamic than Mono – even if that may not be overly obvious with my chosen audios.</p>
