    <h1>Audience & Design</h1>
    <hr>
  	<section id="week2task1">
        <h3>Defining the Audience</h3>
          <p>The intended audience for my website is teachers and educators of teenagers and young people that are daily users of social media. The website would be
						accessible to all teachers, but specifically catered towards those that teach teenagers.
            <br>Below is an Audience Profile Table to illustrate the thought process behind choosing a target audience and the demographic I wish to cater to.
            <table>
              <tr>
                <th>Audience Characteristic</th>
                <th>Rationale</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Age</td>
                <td>In order to prioritise teachers and their ability to use aspects of the website in lessons, the writing will be fairly simplistic and easy to
										understand in order to be transferred easily to teenagers. It will be written in a casual style in order to connect with and convey the
										information effectively.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Gender</td>
                <td>I aim to target a mixed gender audience as teachers come in all genders so will hope to use language that will appeal to any gender.</td>
              </tr> <tr>
                <td>Language Proficiency</td>
                <td>The website will be written in English and aimed towards fluent English speakers.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Education Level</td>
                <td>I will expect the readers to have the reading level of above university level as they are teachers, however the language won't be this complex.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Attitude Toward Writer or Organisation</td>
                <td>I anticipate the audience may be quite intrigued when using this resource. Media literacy and usage is likely an important topic to teachers
									already so hopefully they will welcome a resource designed to help.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Knowledge of the Topic</td>
                <td>They may have a lot of prior knowledge but the website will not be geared towards experts or people with a lot of knowledge on the subject
									and will instead try to aid teachers to imparting their knowledge with their students.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Audience Action</td>
                <td>I want the audience to take this resource and use it in lessons with their students to highlight the importance of media literacy and make them
									 think more critically about the media they're consuming. There will be links to more information with tips and resources on how to be more
									 media literate that hopefully they will share and explore.</td>
              </tr>

        <h3>Evaluation of Design</h3>
          <p>The <a href="http://www.dokimos.org/ajff/">Dokimos</a> website and the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> website have a huge variety of
            differences in design and delivery.<br>
            The Dokimos website is clunky and bright, focussing on images, colour, and animations, compared to the White House website which is more seamless, clean,
            and logical. While the Dokimos website has a lot of information on it, it doesn't deliver or showcase the information in an effective way.
            This is largely due to the chosen design and layout of the site. The navigation is confusing, the colours and graphics are overwhelming and uncohesive, and
            the quality of multimedia is poor. The White House website is sleek and makes sense. It delivers the information effectively and utilises relevant
            multimedia making sure to not overwhelm the website with unnecessary graphics.</p>

        <h3>Establishing Design Ideas</h3>
            <p>My goal is to create a sleek, informative website that is simple to look at, yet not dull or forgetful.<br>Below is a moodboard I have created to
              convey my vision for the website.</p>
