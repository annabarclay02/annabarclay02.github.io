        <h3>Choosing a Topic</h3>
          <p>The effects of social media and increased use of technology on young people has always intrigued me. We are starting to see the impact these have had one young people and how it has affected various aspects of their experiences of the world. I want to understand the effects that technology has had on young people’s media literacy skills and how their overwhelming social media consumption has led to decreased attention spans and low levels of media literacy.</p>
          <p>I would like my website to provide teachers and young people with information on media literacy and its importance, as well as give tips on how teachers can conduct lessons that will help young people consume content critically and make their own judgements on social media content. As a fairly popular topic right now, there are many academic sources and news articles discussing the issue of young people and their media literacy skills and the search terms of “media literacy”, “young people”, “teens”, “attention span” used on combinations with each other gave me lots of results.</p>

            <h3>Readings</h3>
            <p>Reading both scholarly journals and news articles has greatly informed my understanding of the issue at hand and has allowed me to learn and engage with the issues that teachers are facing in their classrooms with students and media literacy.</p>
            <p>Some articles emphasised the effects of social media on young people’s minds like the <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/life/scrolling-through-short-videos-changes-minds-media-literacy/news">Daily Sabah</a>'s and <a href="https://theoxfordblue.co.uk/tiktok-and-the-death-of-the-attention-span/">The Oxford Blue</a>'s, while others emphasised how legislation can aid the teaching of media literacy by making it a key part of the curriculum: <a href="https://blackvoicenews.com/2023/09/27/media-literacy-education-corporate-influence/">Black Voice News</a>.
               Some articles aimed to take advantage of teenagers and their worsening attention spans, with one article from <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/gen-z-has-1-second-attention-span-work-marketers-advantage">Insider Intelligence</a> focussing on how it can be used as a marketing advantage. These articles show that without classroom intervention, media literacy skills will only worsen and deteriorate.</p>
            <p>I also consulted articles based on UX design for teenagers, such as <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-of-websites-for-teenagers/">Nielsen Norman Group</a> and <a href="https://uxplanet.org/7-web-designing-tips-for-developing-a-perfect-website-for-our-teens-58e1206177e2#:~:text=Help%20the%20teens%20digest%20the,lists%20and%20small%20divided%20sections.&text=A%20website%20with%20only%20text,of%20these%20technology%20freak%20teens">UX Planet</a> to understand how teachers may be able to incorporate these aspects into lessons and presentations.
