      <h2>Week 2 Tasks</h2>
        <h3>Independent Tasks</h3>
          <p>The intended audience for my website is teenagers and young people that are daily users of social media. The website would be accessible to all age
            groups, but specifically catered towards teenagers.
            <br>Below is an Audience Profile Table to illustrate the thought process behind choosing a target audience and the demographic I wish to cater to.
            <table>
              <tr>
                <th>Audience Characteristic</th>
                <th>Rationale</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Age</td>
                <td>In order to prioritise teenagers and their understanding of the website, the writing will be fairly simplistic and easy to understand. It will be
                    written in a casual style in order to connect with and convey the information effectively.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Gender</td>
                <td>I aim to target a mixed audience so will hope to use language that will appeal to any gender.</td>
              </tr> <tr>
                <td>Language Proficiency</td>
                <td>The website will be written in English and aimed towards fluent English speakers.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Education Level</td>
                <td>I will expect the readers to have the reading level of upper year high school students.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Attitude Toward Writer or Organisation</td>
                <td>I anticipate the audience may be quite sceptical as they may be unaware of their level of media literacy skills and their importance. I hope
                  they'll be quite open minded to the idea.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Knowledge of the Topic</td>
                <td>They may have some prior knowledge but the website will not be geared towards experts or people with a lot of knowledge on the subject.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Audience Action</td>
                <td>I want the audience to think more critically about the media they're consuming. There will be links to more information and tips on how to me more
                  media literate that hopefully they will take in and explore.</td>
              </tr>
            </table>

        <h3>Lab Tasks</h3>
          <p>The <a href="http://www.dokimos.org/ajff/">Dokimos</a> website and the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> website have a huge variety of
            differences in design and delivery.<br>
            The Dokimos website is clunky and bright, focussing on images, colour, and animations, compared to the White House website which is more seamless, clean,
            and logical. While the Dokimos website has a lot of information on it, it doesn't deliver or showcase the information in an effective way.
            This is largely due to the chosen design and layout of the site. The navigation is confusing, the colours and graphics are overwhelming and uncohesive, and
            the quality of multimedia is poor. The White House website is sleek and makes sense. It delivers the information effectively and utilises relevant
            multimedia making sure to not overwhelm the website with unneccessary graphics.</p>

        <h3>Design Ideas</h3>
            <p>My goal is to create a sleek, informative website that is simple to look at, yet not dull or forgetful.<br>Below is a moodboard I have created to
              convey my vision for the website.</p>
